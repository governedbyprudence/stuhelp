# GREETINGS !

## PROBLEM
#### As per the results of a survey across India on higher education, there were 42,343 colleges and 10,30,996 schools across India.

> For reasons that are as nuanced and diverse as the country itself, India has failed to retain its students in a quality educative environment. - TOI

### Stuhelp offers a centralized feedback system for all students of all institutions for better monitoring of the quality of institutions.

## How do we do it ?

We take ****feedback**** for various aspects of the institute from registered students of that particular institute and run it through our machine learning program for sentiment analysis. 
That data is stored in our server for any type of data analysis to determine the problems faced by students accross any/all institutes.

## Track
#### Education
A better feedback data will help institutes and government analyze the root problems of our broken education system and will be able to take in due action. 
Our data will provide every detail they need to be able to assess where the problem lies and how to fix them.
## Inspiration
Facing numerous issues in school or college, We decided to understand what was going on. We found out that either management does not know what the problem is or are too constrained to work on the problem. So we decided to provide a platform for students to give their unbiased feedback on problems they faced. If our product is imposed by the government on institutes, the quality of education will drastically improve.
