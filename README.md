## PROBLEM
#### As per the results of a survey across India on higher education, there were 42,343 colleges and 10,30,996 schools across India.

> For reasons that are as nuanced and diverse as the country itself, India has failed to retain its students in a quality educative environment. - TOI

### Stuhelp offers a centralized feedback system for all students of all institutions for better monitoring of the quality of institutions.

## How do we do it ?

We take ****feedback**** for various aspects of the institute from registered students of that particular institute and run it through our machine learning program for sentiment analysis. 
That data is stored in our server for any type of data analysis to determine the problems faced by students accross any/all institutes.
